Description: Design and develop a weather application that fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly manner. The app should allow users to search for a specific city and view its current weather conditions along with a 7-day forecast.

Requirements:

UI Design:

Create a visually appealing user interface for the app, including:

A search bar for entering city names.

Current weather display, including temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the weather.

A forecast section showing weather conditions for the next 5 days, including dates, temperatures, and icons.

API Integration:

Utilize a weather API of your choice (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.) to fetch weather data based on the user's search.

Implement error handling for network requests and display appropriate messages to the user if there are connectivity issues or invalid data.

Functionality:

Allow users to enter a city name in the search bar.

Display the current weather data for the specified city, including temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the weather.

Display the 5-day forecast with relevant details for each day.

Implement a refresh mechanism to update the weather data.

State Management:

Use a state management solution such as Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc to manage the app's state effectively.

Persistence:

Implement a simple form of data persistence (e.g., SharedPreferences or Hive) to save the user's last searched city and display it upon app launch.

Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for critical parts of the application, such as API calls, data parsing, and state management.

Responsive Design:

Ensure that the app's UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and orientations.

Documentation:

Provide clear comments in your code to explain the functionality of different components and logic.

Write a brief README that explains how to set up and run the app.

Bonus:

Implement location services to allow users to fetch weather data for their current location.

Add an option to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.

Provide detailed weather information (humidity, wind speed, etc.) in a separate screen.

Enhance the UI with animations and transitions.

Implement a dark mode feature.

Remember to break down the task into manageable steps and commit your code regularly to version control (e.g., Git). This task will help you practice API integration, state management, UI design, and testing within the context of a real-world app
